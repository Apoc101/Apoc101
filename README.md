## About me
Hey, I'm Gabriel but I also go by Apoc and hummusaki. At the time of writing, I currently have over 2 && (haha get it?) 1/2 years of experience, but I'm still learning, planning to go to college for CompSci. 

## What I know
I've been doing Frontend since September 2019 and now I know the basics of Python, JavaScript, C#, SQL, and learning C++.
I also eventually want to get into frameworks, but lack a reason to do so right now.
