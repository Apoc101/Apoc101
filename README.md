<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Gabriel</h1>

## About me
I also go by Apoc and hummusaki. <br>At the time of writing, I currently have over 3 years of experience, but I'm still learning, planning to go to college for software development / infosec. <br>
<br>
As for sofware, I use Firefox Developer edition, a highly customized VSC, Photoshop/Premiere 2020, and Visual Studio for C# apps. As for hardware, I use a 27" 2k as a primary and a vertical 24" 1080p vertically aligned as a second, alongside Akko CS Pinks in an Akko 3068b paired with a Razer Viper Ultimate.

## What I know
I've been doing frontend since September 2019 and now I know the basics of Python, JavaScript, C#, SQL, and learning C++.
I also eventually want to get into frameworks, but don't have a reason to do so right now.
